# DNN

## About DNN
DNN is a dynamic nearest neighbor search library including useful tools to implement algorithms of dynamic environment. 
In dynamic environments, users can insert/delete data and add conditions such as obstacles in nearest neighbor search. Most of the research in geometric problems focused on static environments and the results are optimal or nearly optimal algorithms in various problems. Our project extend these preexisting results to be implemented in dynamic environments.
