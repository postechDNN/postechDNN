# HNN

## What is 'HNN'
The K-Nearest Neighbor Problem (KNN) is a problem of determining which class the data belongs to by comparing the nearest k elements to a given new data. The heuristic K-nearest neighbor problem (HNN) is a problem that solves the KNN in a heuristic setting of the value of the input argument, epsilon.
