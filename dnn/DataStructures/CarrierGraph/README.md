# Carrier Graph v1.2

## What is 'Carrier Graph'
Carrier Graph class is a class for a carrier graph explained in "Orthogonal Shortest Route 
Queries Among Axis Parallel Rectangular Obstacles" by Elgindy & Mitra. 
Carrier Graph is only constructed by disjoint axis-parallel rectangles and points, and 
stores additional points and edges. 
An original carrier graph is DAG (Directly Acyclic Graph), but present version represents this graph as undirected graph.
