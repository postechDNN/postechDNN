# $L_1$ Nearest Neighbor Search in Rectangular Domain (L1NNS) v1.1
## What is '$L_1$ Nearest Neighbor Search in Rectangular Domain'
In the 2D-plane, there are rectangles behaving obstacles and data represented by points. A rectangular domain is a region induced by rectangles with sufficiently large bounding box as an outer boundary. For given a query, $L_1$ Nearest Neighbor Search is to find the nearest data from query under $L_1$ distance (equivalently, rectilinear distance).
