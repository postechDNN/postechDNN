## Half angle line

### Summary
You can draw a half angle line between two lines on the Ipelet.

### How to use
Place 'Marks' in three places in order. 
- Displays one line that makes up the angle, the vertex where the two lines meet, and the other line in that order. 
- After marking the marks, executing'HFAG' in the ipelet function draws a line segment with an arbitrary length to both sides.
